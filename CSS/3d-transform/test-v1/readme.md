# 3D cube with CSS

- Wanted to test how 3D transforms worked in CSS
- This demo is very simple and it mostly just shows what is possible with 3D transforms
	- I made multiple sliders to test how the CSS properties change
	- This whole demo is rendered via CSS and javascript is only used to change classes
- The demo is based on this [3dtransforms](https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/box) article
