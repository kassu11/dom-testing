# Testing CSS colors

- I'm testing how the new `lab` and `lch` color spaces work
- There all also a lot of other color things that I'm testing here
- Currently, I see no difference between `lab`, `lch`, and `rgb colors`, but that is most likely because of my monitor
	- There is a `chance that the colors are just wrong`, but I don't think that is the problem here
	- I will revisit this when I get a better monitor for displaying more colors, but at least all the other color functions and `mixings` work `without a new monitor`
		- They probably will look even more different if my monitor would support them
- Some blocks `don't have a background color currently`, and I'm not sure if they are `not supported` yet, or if they will just `never work`
	- I left them anyway because it's the easiest way to see what works and what doesn't
