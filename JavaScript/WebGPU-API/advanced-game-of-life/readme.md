# Advanced game of life

- This is an updated version of the [Google code labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app) game of life project
- I added support for nonsquare aspect grid ratios
- This also supports dragging so the canvas size doesn't have to be the simulation size
	- You can simulate much larger areas than you can see if you want

## Improvement ideas

- I want to make zooming with scroll and endless canvas would be nice
- When the simulation border comes up, it would be cool to just draw the other side of the simulation area
	- This way the canvas would seem infinite
	- I have no idea how to code this tho :D
