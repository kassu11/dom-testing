# My first WebGPU Thing

- I want to learn to use WebGPU and see what it can do
- This is the first thing that I have done and the material is straight from the [Google code labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app)
- I think the documentation is good and the chapters are simple and easy to follow
- I want to make a more advanced version of this but don't want to ruin this example
- I will make an improved version from the ground up
