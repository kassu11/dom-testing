# Random rhombus tiling

- I was scrolling one night on YouTube and found a [video about this](https://youtu.be/c6J_bd9seMg)
- Honestly, I didn't watch the video, but this seemed like a cool coding challenge, so I coded this
- Don't really know if it's useful but it looks cool and was fun to code
	- I want to make it this more optimized because you can't really simulate a 100 x 100 grid
	- I might make a canvas version of this because this uses elements that start to lag the DOM when you make too many elements
