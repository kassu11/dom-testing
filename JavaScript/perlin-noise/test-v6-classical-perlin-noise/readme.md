# Classic perlin noise

- This version should follow more the Wikipedia definitions, but it sure doesn't look like it :D
    - Even though the result does not look as good as my earlier versions, this can probably produce better caves
    - Also this doesn't use canvases to generate the noise, so you can get just one coordinate point, without generating a full-resolution image
