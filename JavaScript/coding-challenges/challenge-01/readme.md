# Moving elements

- Your goal is to make at least `3 buttons on the screen`
- The buttons can have any text you want inside them
- When `pressed` the button `moves to the opposite side`
	- The `movement` has to be `smooth` so the button `doesn't just teleport` to the other side
	- If for example, if the button has a `10px` gap between the left edge of the page when itâ€™s stationed on the left side, it should also have a `10px` gap to the right page edge when stationed on the right side
- Every button has its own position and `doesn't move until it is clicked`
