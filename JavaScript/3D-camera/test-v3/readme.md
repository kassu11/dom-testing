# CSS 3D Skybox and level editor

- I used the base code from `test-v2-clean` and added some features
- `test-v2` only allowed you to use flat game maps, so I remade the whole editor to support truly 3D worlds
	- The editor is still just numbers on 3D arrays, but it works
- I added an fps counter at the top left of the screen to easily check the performance
- Also added a 3D skybox so it felt more like a fps game
- I'm super happy about this engine and I think it is close to the CSS limits, but I could still add a greedy mashing algorithm to optimize the tile generation
