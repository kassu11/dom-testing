# 3D fps with CSS

- `This is mostly for fun`, just to see how far `CSS can take you`
- It is possible to make a `working fps game` and `render` that game world `using CSS`, but it is `very laggy`
- You have to make a lot of `optimizing` and if your game is not a Minecraft clone it might not be possible to make more than a room without the `website crashing` :D
- So if you want to make a big open-world `game with 3D assets`, probably `use webGL`
