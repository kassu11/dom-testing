# Generating readme file with showDirectoryPicker API

- This site `generates a readme HTML template` that I will use
- It's configurable, but if your `project structure` differs from mine, it might not work
- The code looks for `index.html files` and then makes a link to them
- I used to do this manually to this repository's main `readme.md` file, but now this process has been `automated`
- I started by just testing the `showDirectoryPicker` API, but ended up making a `readme generator`
- Don't know how useful this is to anyone else, but I will use this a lot
