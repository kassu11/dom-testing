# Encypting and decrypting

- Testing how you can encrypt data and decrypt that data back to a readable format
- This is not for any real security, but mostly to just test how to do it
	- Also this could be used to hide puzzle answers in game files to hide them from inspect element

# Libraries used

- I was too lazy to create my own encrypting function, so here are the libraries I used
	- [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js)
	- [js-sha512](https://github.com/emn178/js-sha512)
