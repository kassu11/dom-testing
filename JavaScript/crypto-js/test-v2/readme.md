# Hide things with encryption

- **Disclaimer:** I don't know a lot about encryption, so probably don't take this code and use it in your tip secret security database idk :D
- So here I tested how to hide passwords in your files so that you can't see them easily
- I think this is a secure way of hiding passwords and the only way to solve it would be to brute force your way to a solution, and if your hash is long enough this will probably never be cracked
	- I still don't think it is a good idea to keep anything important hidden in public like this, but for hiding stuff that would not be the end of the world this is fine
	- One example that comes to mind would be a puzzle game where the solutions to the questions are encrypted
	- This way you can't inspect element the solutions
