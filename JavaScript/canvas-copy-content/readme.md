# Testing CanvasRenderingContext2D: putImageData()

- Simple tests that try to combine colors and opacities to different canvases

## test-v1 | Canvas copying

- Draw random rectangles to `5 other canvases`
- After that combine the red channels into one single canvas and use opacity to show the staking
	- The only reason why I did this test, is because I have an idea for a `Perlin noise` use case.

## test-v2 | Canvas copying content & color

- Basically the same code as in `version 1`, but I wanted to make the demo more colorful.
