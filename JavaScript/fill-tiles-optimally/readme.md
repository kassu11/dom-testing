# Fill the space with the least amount of tiles

- This problem probably has a nice and cool name but I will just call it `min-max fill`
	- Use the `minimum amount of tiles` with `maximum tile sizes` to `fill a space`
- I was playing with `3D CSS perspective` and noticed that if your 3D world has over `500 tiles it starts to lag`
- The easiest way of fixing this is to make the tiles bigger and use `background repeat to fill the whole tile`
	- In a `Minecraft` style game engine this will `drastically remove the number of tiles needed`
- So yeah this project is just to test different algorithms to use
