# Shadow dom

- Testing how shadow dom works
- Shadow root hides every element that is in the same child level then it
- Shadow root can not be removed
- Shadow root is basically a normal element, but it can be closed
	- Another element can come on top of shadow roots
	- You can change the root style by using `:host` selector
