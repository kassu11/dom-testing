# Static QuadTree with rectangles

- This is a simple static `QuadTree` implementation in `JavaScript`
	- The version is based on the `version 1` design but supports rectangles now
	- The implementation was inspired by a YouTube video [Quirky Quad Trees Part1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASAowY6yJII)
- The demo highlights all the selected rectangles in white inside the search area
	- You can draw more rectangles using <kbd>Mouse 1</kbd> while dragging the canvas
	- You can also move the search area by hovering over the canvas
		- The search area size is randomly generated
- The code is documented using `JSDoc`
- I might make a `version 3`, that would support moving objects
