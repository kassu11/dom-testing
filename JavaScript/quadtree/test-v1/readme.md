# QuadTree

- This is a simple `QuadTree` implementation in `JavaScript`
	- The code was inspired by CodingTrain's YouTube [coding challenge video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJxEcs0w_kE)
- The demo highlights all the selected points in green inside the search area
	- You can draw more point using <kbd>Mouse 1</kbd> while dragging the canvas
	- You can also move the search area by hovering the canvas
		- The search area size is randomly generated
- The code is documented using `JSDoc`
