# Random numbers with seed

- This is just my first try at making random numbers with a seed
- It seems to work well and also made a very basic and bad hash function
	- Hash function should return the same amount of data always, but this does not
	- It also doesn't change super much like inputs `3` and `4` will give a differing value of 1 :D
	- maybe I will later make a better random number generator and also look onto hash functions
